Idea
A dimensional wall build with two side and a wall of a mirror build a projector of project mapping on one of the mirror will reflected on the two sides of the mirror the Kinect device were place on the top of the mirror, a chair will be place inside the dimensional mirror wall for the audience to feel themselves as a roses which grows within the hand gesture. The two way flow of information between a computer and a user responding to a user input, this implies in the artwork which digital installation Kinect give interaction between the user and the devices. The user will interact in front of the mirror which showing the roses, when the user move a hand gesture the roses started to grows.
